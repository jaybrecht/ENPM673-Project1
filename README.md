# ENPM673-Project1

This project tracks up to 3 AR tags in a video. The program has several modes, all accessible via a series of Boolean toggles at the top of `main.py`.

## Write_to_video
This mode, when set `True`, saves the output of the video to an AVI file. The video will save in the same directory as `main.py`. If you only want to export a video (to watch later) we recommend toggling Fast_mode to True. Fast_mode disables previewing the frames on screen, and offers some performance increases.
